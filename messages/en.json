    "title": "ABOUT_",
    "paragraph1": "My journey in technology began with an insatiable curiosity to understand how things work behind the screen. While studying Systems Analysis and Development at UTFPR, I started diving deep into the web ecosystem — and since then, turning ideas into digital experiences has become my passion.",
    "paragraph2": "Today, I work as a Software Engineer at Union, where we rebuilt an MVP from scratch using Next.js, Turborepo, tRPC, and other technologies that pushed me to think not only about code, but also about performance, accessibility, and the experience of the people using the product. I enjoy crafting interfaces that make sense — visually, technically, and for the person on the other side of the screen.",
    "paragraph3": "Before that, I had intense hands-on experience in infrastructure support at TCS and challenged myself by leading the back-end team in an internship project, where I learned that adaptability and teamwork are just as important as technical knowledge.",
    "paragraph4": "Now, just a few months away from graduation, I see myself as a developer who not only works confidently with tools like TypeScript, React, Tailwind, and Playwright for testing, but also understands the value of clear communication, collaboration, and asking the right questions before searching for any answer.",

    "evolutionQuote": "I am always learning, experimenting, and refining, because to me, good technology is the kind that transforms people, processes, and ideas.",
