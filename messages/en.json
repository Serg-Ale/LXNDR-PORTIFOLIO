    "paragraph1": "My journey in technology began with an insatiable curiosity to understand how things work behind the screen. While studying Systems Analysis and Development at UTFPR, I started diving deep into the web ecosystem — and since then, turning ideas into digital experiences has become my passion.",
    "paragraph2": "Today, I work as a Software Engineer at Union Audio / Union Tech. After being promoted from intern in September 2025, I now lead the development of the Barber App, a SaaS product I'm architecting with Next.js 16, Prisma ORM, and NextAuth. I also contributed to the Union Audio MVP with over 19,000 lines of code, migrating from tRPC to React Query and building a test suite with 308 automated cases.",
    "paragraph3": "Before Union, I had intense hands-on experience at TCS — first as a development intern where I led a 4-person backend team, then as a trainee monitoring 150+ batch jobs for Carrefour logistics with 99.8% uptime. These experiences taught me that adaptability and teamwork are just as important as technical knowledge.",
    "paragraph4": "With 3 years of experience in agile environments and monorepo architectures, I see myself as a developer who not only works confidently with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and modern testing tools, but also understands the value of clear communication, collaboration, and asking the right questions before searching for any answer.",
